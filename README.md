# 🛸 Drone Simulation Toolkit

This repository contains code for simulating and analyzing the performance of a small multirotor drone.  
It includes **aerodynamics simulation**, **battery runtime estimation**, and **motor performance fitting** using both **linear** and **parabolic regression** models.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project was developed to analyze the relationships between drone parameters such as:
- **Rotor thrust**
- **Power consumption**
- **Battery weight**
- **Flight time**
- **Motor efficiency**

By combining aerodynamic principles and empirical motor data fitting, the simulation provides accurate estimates of **drone flight performance** and **battery runtime** under various design configurations.
